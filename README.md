# CICIDS2017_analysis_and_insights
In this project we analyze the CICIDS2017 dataset, conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive insights using ML and DL techniques.
The project is written in python / PyTorch and includes four notebooks:
1. NB1_import_EDA.ipynb - obtain the CICIDS2017 dataset, explore it and gain insights into feature distributions and potential patterns.
2. NB2_intrusion_detection_random_forest.ipynb - a random forest model that applies binary classification to decide if the network traffic is BENIGN or an intrusion.
3. NB3_intrusion_type_classification_NN.ipynb - a NN model that applies multi classification to decide on the type of the intrusion.
4. NB4_anomaly_score.ipynb - Generate an anomaly detection model using Isolation Forest model and analyze the distribution of anomaly scores to identify potential thresholds for flagging suspicious network traffic.
